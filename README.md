## MUSIC Algorithm for Direction of Arrival Estimation of Multiple Sources

Processing   the   signals   received   on   an   array   ofsensors   for   the   location   of   the   source   is   of   great   interest considering the general physical signal phenomena. The general problem considers sensors with arbitrary locations and arbitrary directional  characteristics  (gain/phase/polarization)  in  a  noise environment  of  arbitrary  covariance  matrix. A   description   is   given   of   the   multiple   signal   classification(MUSIC)   algorithm,   which   provides   asymptotically   unbiasedestimates   of   

  1)   Number   of   incident   wavefronts   present
  ## 2)   Directions  of  arrival  (DOA)  (or  emitter  locations)
  3)   Strengths and  cross  correlations  among  the  incident  waveforms  
  4)   Noisestrength  

Examples  and  comparisons  with  methods  based  on maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum entropy (ME), as well as  conventional  beamforming  are  included.  A  simulation  for directions of arrival (DOA) Estimation is performed to show the efficiency  and  parameter  performance  analysis  of  the  proposed algorithm.

Parameter-based experiments of the working of the MUSIC algorithm  for  Direction  of  Arrival  (DOA)  Estimation  can  be conducted, some of which include

  1)  The Spacing between Array Elements
  2)  Increasing Number of Antenna Array
  3)  Increasing the Number of Snapshots
  4)  Increasing the Signal Incidence Angle Difference

The Codes and Plots for the same have been attached in the respective folders.
